# Simulation-of-magnetic-phenomena
A python simulation of magnetic phenomena using the Ising model

In order to simulate an antiferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic material the Ising model of electromagnetism is used. The material is split in a square grid of classical spins and by using a monte-carlo type random simulation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), the spins are flipped until an equilibrium distribution is obtained. From the resulting distribution several magnetic and thermodynamic properties can be measured.
